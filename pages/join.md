<p>Prospective chemistry graduate students interested in the group should apply to the <a href="https://chemistry.illinois.edu/admissions/chemistry-graduate-admissions">UIUC Chemistry Ph.D. program</a>. We also welcome students from Physics, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, and Materials Science and Engineering graduate programs. Graduate students who have been admitted to a Ph.D. program at UIUC are encouraged to contact <a href="/team/#Principal_Investigator">Prof. Jackson</a> (<a href="mailto:jacksonn@illinois.edu">jacksonn@illinois.edu</a>) directly at any time. Students interested in theory and computation should also explore the options available with faculty in the <a href="https://illinoiscatms.web.illinois.edu/">Center for Advanced Theory and Molecular Simulations</a>.</p>

<p>Research in the group is highly interdisciplinary. Students will learn an array of artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches combined with more traditional theoretical and computational chemistry techniques. These approaches include quantum chemical and model hamiltonian electronic structure calculations, classical molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo, coarse-graining, and network analysis. The group maintains multiple on-campus experimental collaborations that are facilitated by involvement in the <a href="https://beckman.illinois.edu/research/molecular-science-and-engineering-research-theme/artificial-intelligence-for-materials">AI for Materials group</a> in the <a href="https://beckman.illinois.edu/">Beckman Institute</a> and <a href="https://moleculemaker.org/research/molecule-material-disc/">Thrust 4</a> of the <a href="https://moleculemaker.org/">Molecular Maker Lab Institute (MMLI)</a>. Through these efforts, students are prepared for a broad set of career opportunities, such as those in specialty chemicals/materials, biotech/pharmaceuticals, scientific software, data science, software engineering, consulting, government, national labs, and academia.</p>
