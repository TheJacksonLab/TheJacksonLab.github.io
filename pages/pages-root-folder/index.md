## Research Overview
The Jackson Lab is a theoretical chemistry research group that models electronic processes (e.g. reactivity, conductivity, optical properties) in soft materials (e.g. polymers, liquid crystals, glasses) using AI and molecular modeling.

The Jackson Lab is an interdisciplinary [team](/team/) of chemists, physicists, and engineers. Each member of the lab is trained to use computational chemistry and AI approaches to address research questions relating to soft materials and electronic properties. We train students and post-docs with backgrounds in chemistry, physics, materials science, or computer science. If you are interested in becoming part of the team, please review our [resources](/software/) page.

Our [research projects](/research/) cover a wide spectrum of chemical theory for soft materials, with an emphasis on electronic transport and AI-guided materials design.

Check the group [publications](/publications/) to see our latest work. We are also actively involved in training the next generation of computational chemists through [resources and tutorials](/software/).

### Group Culture
The Jackson group is committed to maintaining a positive research and learning environment based on open communication, mutual respect, and non-discrimination. The Jackson group will not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, age, gender, economic class, disability, veteran status, religion, color, or national origin. Cultivating a variety of opinions and backgrounds is fundamental to the scientific work that we do on a daily basis.
